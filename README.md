## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of **Regenerative Braking**, a system that recovers energy during braking and stores it for future use.

Instead of wasting kinetic energy as heat during braking, the motor operates in **generator mode** and converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, which is stored back into the battery.

## 🎯 Objective

- To design a working prototype of a regenerative braking system  
- To demonstrate energy recovery during braking  
- To improve system efficiency  
- To reduce energy loss

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. During normal operation, the DC motor runs using battery supply.
2. When braking is applied, the motor switches to generator mode.
3. The rotating shaft’s kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy.
4. The generated energy flows back to the battery through a diode.
5. Energy is stored instead of being wasted as heat.
