# Regenerative-Braking-System-for-Ev-Vehicle-
This project demonstrates the working principle of a regenerative braking system. In this system, when the vehicle slows down, the motor operates as a generator and converts kinetic energy into electrical energy. The generated energy is stored in a battery instead of being wasted as heat.
